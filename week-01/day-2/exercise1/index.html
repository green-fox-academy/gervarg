        <h2>Wannabe Hardware Developer</h2>
        <p>I would love to write programs designed for embedded hardware, to learn new things I have never before.</p>
        <p>I am also really interested in machine learning in python, and I really hope someday I can join a company which works with
    these kind of algorithms. </p>

        <h4>Logic Gate</h4>
        <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on
            one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. </p>
        <h4>ASCII</h4>
        <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is
            the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
        <h4>Random-access memory</h4>
        <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed
            of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time
            irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
        <h4>Programming language</h4>
        <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They
            generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
        <h4>Domain Name System</h4>
        <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet
            or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating
            entities.
        </p>
        <h4>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h4>
        <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation
            of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.</p>
